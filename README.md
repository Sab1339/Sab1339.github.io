        <h3>And saving stress when to do it!</h3>
<p> Have you ever worked yourself tired? Fell sleep with laundry still on the bed? Keep saying your going to clean the bath tub and forgetting to buy the cleaners at the store? With this blog, I hope to help people entering the adult world and re entering living a more independent life by this blog!I hope I can help anyone reading this reverse any negative habits that we are trying to eliminate from our daily routine!</p>
        <p>It is said that when there is a full moon it is the end of another cycle. I personally take a full moon as a restart to how I want to start off my week. First, I think of what I want to eliminate from my daily routines, and what I would like to add. For example, eating less salt in my foods and adding more greens and vegetables into my diet. In this case it would be cleaning my household more often so that it may appear neat whenever I have guests over. When visualizing our goal we also have to think of the steps to get there. So, lets say our full moon falls on a Friday, so Saturday morning would be the day to start our new routine. Now, if you find it hard to break old habits, I suggest starting off with something small, like trying not to go back to sleep when waking up. When you first wake up, look at the time. Think of what you have been wanting to do at this time, everytime you wake up later than this time. Maybe we can use this extra time to clean, or throw out the trash. Maybe even put our outfits together for the day. It doesn't matter how small the task, we usually have to start somewhere, and we can start to begin having full control of our actions and time throughout the day. </p>
        <p>When it comes to cleaning, it is best to start when we feel like everything feels cluttered around us, physically and emotionally. Have you ever been home and have been bored out of your mind? Wanted friends over but have to get ahead of your chores first? This would be a good time to look around you and ask yourself, "If I had company right now, would I be embarassed by how my house/rooms looks?" Now that we have the ability to change something, and are incredibly bored, it would help to start cleaning! At first it might be boring, usually when I clean I put on a playlist of my favorite songs to help put me in a more patient mood, so I can put everything up more neat and with more compassion, versus just trying to more everything around into a neater pile.</p>
        <p>This is a good time to go through everything that meets your eye in your home/room. So, if something is always in your way, throw it out if you have absolutely no use for it! If your tired of having your furniture a certain way, switch it around every now and then. Doing this will help ground us into our home, and feel more comfortable where we live. Just because we live here, doesn't mean it doesnt have to look presentable. Afterall, sometimes our homes and rooms say a lot about us. But imagine always being busy and always having a neat and clean room/house? It would make it seem that we have everything in our life in order. So turn that frown upside down, and turn your upside down life, back right side up!</p>
        <h2 id="simple-meals">Cooking Simple Meals</h2>
        <h3>And saving money when doing it!</h3>
        <p>Have you ever worked and worked and it felt like no matter how much you save you never have enough? Always feel bloated and drained? You might be a victim of fastfood, or what I like to call a fast food junkie. Now take a moment and think about how many times you have ate fast food this week. Now how about for the month? Fast food was originally created for the working class to stop by a restaurant and have enough time for the food to cook and eat it before it is time to clock back into work after lunch. But when people are hungry and desperite to eat something fast so they can go back to work really quick, do you think they are truly going over the consequences in their head of consuming fast food almost every other day?</p>
        <p>When it comes to cooking simple meals at home, yes it may be time consuming, and sometimes even uncomfortable if your kitchen tends to get real hot when you cook. However, when it comes to time, it is a currency that is basically free. Depending on what we do with our time equals the fate of our consequences. So, if we were to play video games all day and never study, we would more than likely fail a test over what we were supposed to study. So when it comes to finances and our well being, whatever we consume daily affects us in almost every aspect of life.</p>
        <p>The plus side of fast food is that is open up more employment opportunities for the working and low income class. However, when it comes to our health as people, it may not be as great. Throughout the years fast food has be made up mostly of unhealthy food options such as meat, beef, fried foods, and sugary drinks. But if we were to go to the grocery store, we can buy the exact ingredients most these places make their food from, for cheaper than what we pay for a meal everyday for a week. If I were to buy tomatoes, lettuce, ground beef, and tortillas, I can feed the whole family and still have money leftover, versus taking everyone out to eat.</p>
        <p> Now with technology, we can Google pretty much any recipe or look it up online on Youtube and make it for ourselves at home. However, if you work every day and find yourself too tired to cook everyday for lunch, I would suggest dedicating certain days of your week to meal prep or at least cook what you don't mind eating for the next few days. Making sure our refrigerator at home stays clean will let the food stay fresh and cool inside the refrigertator and also keep the food tasting fresh as well! Also be sure to consume some vegetables and or fruits everyday to help our body rid itself of toxins that we ingest from certain foods such as fast food, poultry, and overly sugared foods.</p>
        <h2 id= "treat-yourself">Treat Yourself</h2>
        <h3>And spreading the love while doing it!</h3>
        <p>When it comes to being depressed or diagnosed with anxiety or any other mental illness, doing simple things like treating ourselves can also be challenging. Life may be important, but so is your happiness. If you often find yourself stressed it is okay to give your brain a break every now and then. Sometimes when my brain feels tired I usually take a break and try whatever I was working on at another time when I feel more rested. If you ever feel like something simple feels impossible, I want you to take a mental and physical break. Whether its at least watching 1 episode of your favorite show, or snacking on soomething, or even both, be sure to give your body and brain a break to help prevent any extra stress.</p>
        <p>When it comes to social media we get to see all our friends ways of "treating yourself". But sometimes I feel we get confused with what we want with what other people want. We might see friends on a trip to Italy with other friends or maybe family meeting up with other family in out of state adventures. It might make us feel leftout or unloved at the moment, but we also have to ask ourselves how we would feel at this exact moment. Maybe stressed out because your not an outdoorsy person, or too comfortable that it might take away from others' experience. Whatever the case, it is because we fail to treat ourselves. So when we see others treating theirselves it makes it hard for us because we never got to experience the moment the same. Which is why it is important to <strong>TREAT YOURSELF</strong>, because not only will it help you feel happier on the inside, but it will also <strong>help your happiness radiate into everyone's lives around you</strong></p>
